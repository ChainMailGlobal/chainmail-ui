# ChainMail Global â€“ UI Layer

This is the public front-end interface for **MailboxHero Pro** and **ChainMail Global**, providing real-time onboarding and compliance automation for Commercial Mail Receiving Agencies (CMRAs), virtual address providers, and tokenized real estate platforms.

## ðŸš€ XRPL Integration Overview

While this repository primarily contains UI components, our broader platform is deeply integrated with the XRP Ledger (XRPL), using the following primitives:

- **XLS-20 NFTokens** â€“ Used to mint CMID (ChainMail Identity) tokens embedding AI-witness data, geolocation proofs, and biometric hashes.
- **XRPL Memos** â€“ Each compliance action is immutably logged to the ledger.
- **Payment Channels** â€“ For micro-billing CBIT utility tokens during mailbox access events.
- **Upcoming Integrations:**
  - RLUSD for stablecoin-based compliance fee settlement.
  - Hooks for automated re-verification and enforcement logic.
  - XRPL AMMs to enable liquidity for tokenized real estate (CMPT).
  - XRPL EVM Sidechain for DAO governance and cross-chain interoperability.

## ðŸ”’ Private Code Note

Backend logic, identity compliance infrastructure, and smart contract implementations are held in a private repository pending audit. Demo code and architecture documentation available on request under NDA.
